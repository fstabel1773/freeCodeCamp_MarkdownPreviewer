# About this repo

This repo contains the second of five required solo projects from freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries course.
It is a Markdwon-Previewer built on my own from scratch according to user stories (see below). 
The app uses react-framework and vite as bundler. 

Markdown-Previewer-App live demo available: [*coming soon*](https://app.netlify.com/sites/adorable-croquembouche-1c0e1b/overview).


Note: There is a testscript from freeCodeCamp included confimring fullfilling of user stories.

### User Stories
User Story #1: I can see a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".

User Story #2: I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".

User Story #3: When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.

User Story #4: When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).

User Story #5: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a heading element (H1 size), a sub heading element (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.

User Story #6: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.
